## MVP Specification: Anki Add-on for Creating Flashcards from Homework Screenshots

**1. Goal:**

To develop an Anki add-on that streamlines the process of creating flashcards for new English nouns encountered during homework. The add-on will allow users to take a screenshot of their homework with underlined words, extract these words, and easily create corresponding Anki notes for vocabulary learning.

**2. Target User:**

Language learners who use Anki for vocabulary acquisition and want a more efficient way to create flashcards from their study materials.

**3. Core Functionality (MVP):**

The add-on will enable users to:

* Paste a screenshot containing underlined English nouns into a dedicated Anki window.
* See a preview of the text fragments extracted from the image.
* Select the English nouns they want to create flashcards for.
* View a preview of the Anki notes that will be created for each selected noun.
* Confirm and export these notes directly into their Anki collection.

**4. User Flow:**

1.  **Capture Screenshot:** The user takes a screenshot of their homework or study material where new English nouns are underlined.
2.  **Open Dedicated Window:** The user opens a dedicated window within the Anki application provided by the add-on.
3.  **Paste Screenshot:** The user presses `Ctrl+V` to paste the screenshot into the dedicated window.
4.  **Initial Text Extraction:** The add-on utilizes an LLM API to perform OCR on the image and extracts all text fragments.
5.  **Select Target Nouns:** The add-on displays a simple multi-select list of the extracted text fragments. The user selects the English nouns they wish to create flashcards for.
6.  **Generate Note Data (LLM):** For each selected noun, the add-on uses the LLM API to:
    * Identify the sentence in the screenshot where the noun occurs.
    * Generate a concise "concept" (meaning) for the noun in that specific context.
    * Provide the singular and plural forms of the noun.
7.  **Preview Notes:** The add-on presents a nested preview (using a tree table structure) of the Anki notes that will be created:
    * **Top Level:** The selected extracted noun.
    * **Nested Items:**
        * **Meaning Note (with checkbox):**
            * Sentence: \[Extracted sentence from LLM]
            * Concept: \[Generated concept from LLM]
        * **English Noun Note (with checkbox):**
            * Singular: \[Singular form from LLM]
            * Plural: \[Plural form from LLM]
8.  **Confirm and Export:** The user reviews the preview and selects the "Meaning" and/or "English noun" notes they want to create for each word using the checkboxes. They then click an "Export to Anki" button.
9.  **Export in Progress:** The add-on's GUI grays out to indicate that the export process is running.
10. **Feedback:**
    * **Success:** Upon successful export, a message "Successfully exported the selected notes to Anki" is displayed.
    * **Error:** If an error occurs during export, a simple message "An error occurred during export. Please try again." is displayed.

**5. Anki Note Types (Pre-requisite for MVP):**

It is assumed that the following note types are already created and available in the user's Anki profile:

* **"Meaning" Note Type:**
    * Fields: `sentence`, `concept`
    * Card Template: Generates a cloze deletion card based on the `sentence` field.
* **"English noun" Note Type:**
    * Fields: `singular`, `plural`
    * Card Template: Generates two cards: one showing the singular form and asking for the plural, and another showing the plural form and asking for the singular.

**6. Technology Stack (MVP):**

* **Anki Add-on Development:** Python
* **GUI Framework:** PyQt
* **OCR and NLP:** LLM API (specific API to be determined)

**7. Error Handling (MVP):**

Basic error messages will be displayed to the user in case of issues during the export process.

**8. Future Considerations (Beyond MVP):**

* Support for German nouns (including gender).
* Allowing users to edit the extracted text and the LLM-generated information before export.
* Integration with a dictionary for more reliable word form retrieval.
* Support for other card types (e.g., vocabulary with definitions, example sentences).
* More detailed error reporting and logging.

**9. Architecture & Code Organization**

* The project follows a **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** approach with a single bounded context: `aicards`.
* The codebase is organized into vertical slices:
    * **base:** Contains shared data structures and interfaces (using Python protocols) for dependency inversion.
    * **core:** Contains business logic, including all interactions with the Anki API and the LLM API, implemented against interfaces defined in `base`.
    * **gui:** Implements the PyQt GUI, orchestrates user interactions, and communicates with `core` using objects and interfaces defined in `base`.
* All dependencies between layers are explicit and follow dependency inversion principlesâ€”hidden dependencies are avoided.
* Data exchanged between `gui` and `core` is represented by complex objects (e.g., dataclasses) defined in `base`.
* Modern Python (>=3.13) features are used throughout the codebase (e.g., `list[str]` instead of `typing.List[str]`).

**10. Tooling & Automation**

* Python package management is handled using the `uv` package.
* Automation scripts are run using `./dodo.py <args>`.

## 11. User Interface (UI)

The proposed user interface for the Anki add-on, based on the provided sketch, is designed within a dedicated window and guides the user through the workflow via distinct sections:

1.  **Image Display Area (Step #1):**
    * **Location:** Top-left section of the window.
    * **Purpose:** Displays the screenshot pasted by the user (via `Ctrl+V`), providing visual context for the extracted text.

2.  **Extractions List (Step #2):**
    * **Location:** Top-right section, adjacent to the Image Display Area.
    * **Purpose:** Shows the text fragments (nouns, phrases, phrasal verbs, ...) identified by OCR from the pasted image.
    * **Interaction:** Functions as a multi-select list where the user chooses the extractions to be used as seeds for different Anki notes.

3.  **Confirmation Action (Step #3):**
    * **Location:** Positioned between the Extractions List and the Note Preview Area.
    * **Component:** A "**Confirm**" button.
    * **Purpose:** Triggers LLM processing (context, concept, grammatical forms, ...) for the extractions selected in the Extractions List.

4.  **Note Preview & Selection Area (Step #4):**
    * **Location:** The main, larger area below the Image Display and Confirmation Action.
    * **Structure:** Organized as a tree table or an expandable list.
    * **Content:**
        * **Top Level:** Lists each extraction selected from the Extractions List (e.g., `+ Electricity`, `+ drinking`).
        * **Nested Levels:** Expanding an extraction reveals potential Anki notes, for which this particular extraction should be used as seed:
            * **Grammar:** Shows data for the `"English Noun"` note type (Singular/Plural forms).
            * **Meaning:** Shows data for the `"Meaning"` note type (Term/Concept and Example Sentence).
    * **Interaction (Implied by SPEC):** This area will incorporate checkboxes (as specified in SPEC section 4, steps 7 & 8, though not explicitly drawn in the sketch) next to "Grammar" and "Meaning" sub-items. This allows users to select precisely which note types to export for each chosen extraction.

5.  **Final Export Action (Sketch #5):**
    * **Location:** At the bottom of the window.
    * **Component:** An "**Import into Anki database**" button.
    * **Purpose:** Initiates the export of the user-selected notes (from the Preview Area) into their Anki collection.

**Expected UI Flow:**

1.  User pastes a screenshot into the **Image Display Area (1)**.
2.  The add-on performs OCR and populates the **Extractions List (2)**.
3.  User selects desired extractions from the **Extractions List (2)**.
4.  User clicks the **Confirm button (3)**.
5.  The add-on retrieves detailed note data using the LLM and displays it in the **Note Preview Area (4)**.
6.  User reviews the generated data in the **Note Preview Area (4)**, using the expandable structure and checkboxes to finalize selections for e.g. the `Meaning` and `English Noun` notes for each extraction.
7.  User clicks the **Import into Anki database button (5)**.
8.  The UI provides success or error feedback.
